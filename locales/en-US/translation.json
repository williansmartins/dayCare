We also nurture them socially, emotionally and physically so they are confident and happy. We believe that positive reinforcement is important for children to develop self-esteem. Activities designed to stimulate their senses and natural curiosity, expand on their language development and understanding, and build their fine and gross motor skills will be offered daily.",

The mother and daughter, who are the owners and care givers, are real teachers with degrees in early childhood education. If you want your child to feel part of a family and be in a warm and nurturing environment this is the place!!!"
