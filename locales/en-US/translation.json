We also nurture them socially, emotionally and physically so they are confident and happy. We believe that positive reinforcement is important for children to develop self-esteem. Activities designed to stimulate their senses and natural curiosity, expand on their language development and understanding, and build their fine and gross motor skills will be offered daily.",

We provide children with the tools and resources necessary to explore and discover the world around them while having fun every day. Through hands-on activities, encouragement, exploration and learning, Sabrina's Child Care supports each child's differing abilities.",
